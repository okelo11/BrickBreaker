# How the paddle works
![](ImageForGithub/paddle-ball%20reflection.png)
If the ball comes from left to %25 of the paddle's left side,ball reflects in the opposite direction.if the ball comes from left to paddle but not to %25 of the paddles's left side,ball reflects as an object in front of the mirror.This is the same for the ball coming from the righ side.
# How the InGameMenu works
If the player clicks three times in the game level,InGameMenu appears.There is an default time for triple tap detection and an extension time.if the player clicks,every click extends default time for 0.5 seconds.This was done to get the best result if the player wants to open inGameMenu.
